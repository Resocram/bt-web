# bt-web
Biztech's web application.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project to a live system.

### Installation and Running

1. Clone the repo:

    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/ubc-biztech/bt-web
    ```

2. Install the packages:

    ```
    $ npm install
    ```

3. Your setup is ready for development! Run `npm start` to run your app on your local machine.


## Development

### Files and Services

* `components/` - Our main view/display components
* `pages/` - Our main pages, where most of our app logic is handled

* `assets/` - Images, fonts, vectors, and other static files
* `constants/` - Abstracted constants
* `utils/` - Any other miscellaneous functions

* `actions/` - Action creators for redux
* `reducers/` - Reducers (action listeners) for redux

### Linting

Linters are put into place to exercise good and consistent coding style, regardless of developer. Editing lint rules can be done by changing the `.eslintrc.js` file.


## Deployment

Our web application can be deployed through a simple build-and-deploy process:

### Build
The web application can be built using either of the commands:
```
npm run generate
```
or for production environment:
```
npm run generate:prod
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- `npm start` - Runs the app in the development mode.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

- `npm run build` - Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Afer this, your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

- `npm run generate` - Builds the app into the `build` folder for stage environment.

- `npm run generate:prod` - Deploys the app from the `build` folder for production use.

- `npm run deploy` - Deploys the app from the `build` folder to aws s3 for website hosting.

- `npm run test` - Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

- `npm run lint` - Runs linter and automatically fixes all lint problems. You may need to install eslint first `npm i -g eslint`
